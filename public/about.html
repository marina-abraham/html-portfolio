<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Marina Abraham. I am 11 years old. Turning 12 in Septembre. 
I am currently taking a web development programe/course in the summer of 2023.
I enjoy this course because I am learning so much nice stuff and how to program lots
of new stuff and how to do projects.</p>

<p>My favorite project that I have done so far is probably the birthday invite 
that I displayed on the previous page. It was to invente some information
and put it in the html files and make it look nice. Angela taught me 
so much cool stuff. She always makes project super fun.</p>

<p>I love doing this course and spending a few hours per day to learn
about coding. Angela gives such good lessons and exemples on how to learn the 
ew stuff. This is why I love doing this even if it is during summer my dad also works as a programer
and we encourage each other by working beside each other and my dad always
helps me with the chalenging stuff.
